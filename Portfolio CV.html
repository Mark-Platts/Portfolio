      <ul>
        <li>Programming is for code based projects, most of which were built while I was experimenting with or learning new skills. These are the bulk of the portfolio.</li>
        <li>Educational is for tools I have made to show off ideas and to allow exploration of a concept, usually in mathematics or physics. Projects with a * are also portfolio pieces that show off certain abilties in coding.</li>
        <li>Future Projects is for projects that aren't quite finished but are far along enough to be worth showing off.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each project has an information section at the bottom with an explanation of what I wanted to accomplish and what I wanted to learn from the project.</p>
