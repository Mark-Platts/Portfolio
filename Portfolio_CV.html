            <p>I am a former graduate student of Mathematical Physics and a Private Tutor that desires to use my problem solving, analysis, and understanding
               of complex systems skills in a programming role. I have many years of programming experience working on various projects created for my interests or during my degrees.
              I adore the freedom of invention that programming allows and, in my spare time, I continue to push my skills further.</p>
