      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I am Mark Platts, I'm 28 years old. My background is in mathematical physics and private tutoring,
        but I am now aiming for a career in programming. I would consider any programming role as they all interest me for different reasons.
        However, I would be most happy in a job with a lot of complex problems to solve. <br><br>
        Also, I am currently still a private tutor for hire. Feel free to contact me regarding tutoring jobs.

        <h3>Interests:</h3>
        <p>My main interests are mathematics, physics, and programming. I have a deep love for figuring out how things work which eventually led to
          my MSc in Mathematical Physics. I now continue to work towards a general understanding of the current theories of physics and when I have time
          I push my understanding of different areas in pure mathematics. Right now though the bulk of my time is spent exploring as many programming
          tools as I can to add to my belt. Whilst programming started off as a useful tool in my other endevours, I have since seen the endless possibilities
          that it allows and I have fallen in love with the process of turning an idea into a final product. <br><br> For a more detailed look at my main interests:
        </p>
        <h3>Mathematics and Physics:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Quantum Theory:</b> My Msc layed a good foundation here that I wish to expand upon as time goes on.
          I am mainly working towards a better understanding of Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Loop Quantum Gravity.
        I am also experimenting right now with visualising Quantum Mechanics with code generated animations.</li>
          <li><b>Geometry:</b> I love geometry in general but am fascinated by its higher dimensional generalisations.
          I am working towards a better understanding of algebraic geometry, group theory, lie-algebras, differential geometry, and applications of
        higher dimensional geometry to systems analysis. I have created a web app that shows off the 4-dimensional convex regular polytopes,
       and now I am experimenting with using machine learning to approximate ellipses that fit given data. Eventually, I hope to return to
      experiments in programming differential forms for use in research inspired by my dissertation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Programming:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>UI design and engineering:</b> I still remember when I first learned the power of adding an interface to your code.
          At first, I used it to build many game interfaces. Now I use it to build web apps for anything I feel would be useful (usually to students).
        I am still deeply fascinated by how much you can do with JavaScript and CSS and I ike the challenge of figuring out how to make an interface do something interesting
