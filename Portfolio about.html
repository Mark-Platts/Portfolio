        <li>Programming is for code based projects, most of which were built while I was experimenting with or learning new skills. These are the bulk of the portfolio.</li>
        <li>Educational is for tools I have made to show off ideas and to allow exploration of a concept, usually in mathematics or physics. Projects with a * are also portfolio pieces that show off certain abilties in coding.</li>
