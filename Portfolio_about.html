      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I am Mark Platts, I'm 28 years old. My background is in mathematical physics and private tutoring,
        but I am now aiming for a career in programming. I would consider any programming role as they all interest me for different reasons.
        However, I would be most happy in a job with a lot of complex problems to solve. <br><br>
        Also, I am currently still a private tutor for hire. Feel free to contact me regarding tutoring jobs.
      </p>

        <h3>What makes you tick?</h3>
        <p>I have always had an onbession with understanding how things work and learning in general. This led me to study physics and mathematics so that I could get
          a fundamental understanding of how everything else works. In my spare time I have studied a variety of topics that themselves form complex systems.
          These include: linguistics and languages, engineering, chess, strategy, military organisation, music theory, and more. For all of these I
          enjoy the feeling of understanding how it all works and fits together.
             Programming has been an amazing discovery for me due to the fact that not only is it itself a deep and meaningful endevour,
          but it also lends itself to so many other areas. I began learning to code in order to explore areas of maths and physics and to learn
          how games work. Before long I discovered how fascinating programming is for its own sake and I started challenging myself to learn to
          do more and more.</p>

      <article id="interests">
        <h3>Interests:</h3>
        <p>My main interests are mathematics, physics, and programming. I have a deep love for figuring out how things work which eventually led to
          my MSc in Mathematical Physics. I now continue to work towards a general understanding of the current theories of physics and when I have time
          I push my understanding of different areas in pure mathematics. Right now though the bulk of my time is spent exploring as many programming
          tools as I can to add to my belt. Whilst programming started off as a useful tool in my other endevours, I have since seen the endless possibilities
          that it allows and I have fallen in love with the process of turning an idea into a final product. <br><br> For a more detailed look at my main interests:
        </p><br>
        <h3>Mathematics and Physics:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding:10px 20px;">
          <li><b>Quantum Theory:</b> My Msc layed a good foundation here that I wish to expand upon as time goes on.
          I am mainly working towards a better understanding of Quantum Field Theory, String Theory, and Loop Quantum Gravity.
        I am also experimenting right now with visualising Quantum Mechanics with code generated animations.</li>
          <li><b>Geometry:</b> I love geometry in general but am fascinated by its higher dimensional generalisations.
          I am working towards a better understanding of algebraic geometry, group theory, lie-algebras, differential geometry, and applications of
        higher dimensional geometry to systems analysis. I have created a web app that shows off the 4-dimensional convex regular polytopes,
       and now I am experimenting with using machine learning to approximate ellipses that fit given data. Eventually, I hope to return to
      experiments in programming differential forms for use in research inspired by my dissertation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Programming:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding:10px 20px;">
          <li><b>UI design and engineering:</b> I still remember when I first learned the power of adding an interface to your code.
          At first, I used it to build many game interfaces. Now I use it to build web apps for anything I feel would be useful (usually to students).
        I am still deeply fascinated by how much you can do with JavaScript and CSS and I like the challenge of figuring out how to make an interface do something interesting
          </li>
          <li><b>Numerics and calculators:</b> Maths and Physics contain a lot interesting ideas that require an intense or even infinite amount of calculation effort. 
            I find myself often writing scripts to take care of these unmanagable calculations so that I can see the results of things that I would never be 
            able to do by hand or with a typical calculator. You can see an example of this in the explanation for my Convex Regular Polytop Renderer (link).
          </li>
          <li><b>Machine Learning:</b>I have been fascinated by this area for many years and I have a lot of projects in mind once I know more. 
          I have played with different A.I. designs for games that I have built. I have also experiemented with stochastic and gradient-step based machine learning 
        for different areas of mathematics. Now I am spending some of my free time learning Neural Network machine learning.</li>

      <article id="whyNewCar">
        <h3>Why have you decided to change career?</h3>
        <p>For the past few years I have known how much I love programming. It slowly became one of my main hobbies and I worked on many
          ideas, requiring me to learn and apply new programming skills. However, I always assumed my skills were of amature level. Truly, the only reason
          I didn't try for a programming career sooner is that I didn't realise it was accessible to me.
           Eventually, I began working on colaborative ideas with my good friend Colin Broderick (link). He is a Systems Enginner and does programming profesionally. 
          He made me realise that I was good enough to do programming as a job. I realised after that point that I would be much happier in a 
          programming role, especially an engineer style one. Since then I have working hard to learn skills that are useful to a wide range
          of programming roles, whilst also building up a portfolio to show off my work.</p>

      <article id="goals">
        <h3>What role would make you happiest? What are your goals?:</h3>
        <p>In my own personal work, I am happiest when I have something that needs to be figured out/made/done and I am working out how to achieve that.
          I enjoy the process I working towards the solution with experiments here and there, and I love the satisfaction of parts coming together to 
          make something bigger happen. Of course, the greatest joy is when each peice clicks together and the goal is achieved. All of these things exist in 
          many programming roles, but I feel that with these ideas and my maths and physics background that I would be happiest in an engineering role.

        <h3>What do you think are your main selling points?:</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-position: inside; padding:10px 20px;"> 
          <li>I am a fast learner and thorough too: Years of self tutoring many varied subject have allowed me to hone my abilities to take on a new subject 
            and efficiently gets to grips with it. As well as this, I learn best from actually doing the subject myself and I tend to only call a skill 
          understood when I can demonstrate my ability to do it. Hence this portfolio.</li><br>
          <li>I am a self-teacher: Related to the above, most of what I know is self taught as I find I learn best that way. For a job this means that if I 
            need a skill that I don't already have, I am more than happy to go and learn it independently.
          </li><br>
          <li>I love problem solving: You can see from my <a href="#interests">interests</a> above that I gravitate towards areas with things to work out. 
          I love the feeling of getting to know a problem and the satisfaction of finding a way to solve it. I also have a lot of experience learning 
        and understanding deep and complex systems.</li><br>
          <li>I am a good communicator: Working as a tutor has given me a lot of practice in communicating complex ideas to others, even when they 
            themselves have little knowledge in the area.
          </li><br>
          <li>I prefer a thorough understanding of anything I work on as opposed to just learning the bare minimum. If I'm learning how to do something, 
            often wish to achieve my own ideas with those skills and I work towards a general understanding that allows me to customise those skills to any needs.

      <h1>Explanation for this page:</h1>
      <p>For this page, I wanted to split each answer up so that the page was less congested. I also wanted something interesting to happen in the gaps. 
        In the end, this page became a testing ground for the parallax effect on the images between each answer. (Note: due to phone browser issues, this effect 
        only works on larger screens.)
